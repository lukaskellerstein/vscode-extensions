"""
Single Agent Example (3c): Agent with External MCP Tools (Playwright)

Demonstrates connecting to external MCP servers like Playwright for browser automation.
This example shows how to integrate with MCP servers running as separate processes.
"""

# ============================================================================
# IMPORTANT: This example uses ClaudeSDKClient with EXTERNAL MCP servers!
# ============================================================================
# Unlike 3b_agent_with_custom_tools.py which creates tools using @tool decorator,
# this example connects to external MCP servers (like Playwright) that run as
# separate processes and provide their own tools.
#
# Prerequisites:
# 1. Install Playwright MCP server:
#    npx @playwright/mcp@latest
#
# 2. The Playwright MCP server provides browser automation tools like:
#    - browser_navigate: Navigate to a URL
#    - browser_click: Click on elements
#    - browser_type: Type text into elements
#    - browser_snapshot: Get page accessibility snapshot
#    - browser_screenshot: Take page screenshots
#    - browser_evaluate: Execute JavaScript
#
# You can also connect to other external MCP servers following the same pattern.
